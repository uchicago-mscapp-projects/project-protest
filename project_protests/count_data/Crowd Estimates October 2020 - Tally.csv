This will be an opportunity to stand together against the destructive agenda of Donald Trump and those who support him.      In this time of national distress, we need to come together in supporting the highest ideals of the United States of America.   At this time, “Liberty and Justice for ALL” finally needs to mean every human being.       Please join us in celebrating Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, standing against the dictatorship/theocracy that Trump supporters want, and standing with each other to declare that we are not going back.      The event will be on the Capitol Steps.  I had initially reserved the Fountain Plaza for its ease of access but the folks in charge said with the number of people (155 and counting!) we would be better on the steps. The Capitol Steps is on the Commonwealth Avenue side (west side right at the intersection of State Street and Third Street) of the Pennsylvania Capitol.   Parking will be free around the park on the other side of the capitol, Soldiers’ Grove, across Commonwealth Avenue, across from the fountain.  Stop and see the fountain anyway since it is dyed a lovely pink for Breast Cancer Awareness Month.    otherwise, parking will be for a fee on the streets and garages.  Info is here: https://parkharrisburg.com/      The steps are a very good venue, getting plenty of exposure but they are not conducive to folks with disabilities, being historical and not ADA compliant.  The sidewalk does come right up to them at the bottom.   The top drive is limited access for security reasons.      I am not going to have portable toilets because of the relatively short duration of the event.   Please pee before you come.  There are restaurants nearby but none will welcome the public just wandering in.  But they are great for a lunch!  The capitol will be open through the entrance at the top of the steps, but again, this is not accessible for disabled folks.  The PA capitol is gorgeous.      I am accessing a decent sound system so we can be heard.  We are looking for speakers. Please contact me.     Mask wearing and social distancing will be enforced.    Since it is close to Halloween, wear a costume of your favorite unruly woman.  :)  As for what to bring: a sign if you'd like:  nothing contraband;  a cushion of blanket if you'd like to sit on the steps or the walls around them, a couple places can also handle a foldable chair;  a hat if you are sensitive to the sun, something to drink if you'd like.   A bunch of restaurants are close by downtown.        The fountain at the Capitol will be dyed pink for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, so it should be a pretty venue.

Oct. 17, 2020 @3pm - 4:30pm  *Masks and practicing safe social distancing guidelines required*    ?JOIN US ? On October 17th — Women’s March is planning a massive, nationwide march to send an unmistakable message that we will not allow the current government administration to endanger our lives any longer. This is what we’ve been preparing for...this is why millions of women of all ages and their allies marched on January 21, 2017.  We are called to RISE UP to the urgency of this moment. We have to show up and march for ALL women – for Trans, Black, Indigenous, and Brown women, and for future generations.  In the wake of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s passing, thousands of Women’s Marchers gathered across the country in their communities to honor the life and legacy of the Notorious RBG. Together, we showed the world that this movement is more committed and fired up than ever to carry on the fight for justice and equality that RBG championed for so many years.  NOW is the time to build on RGB's legacy, along with all the heroic women who came before her. We must go beyond words posts, and move into action with everything we have to protect the courts and defeat tyranny & injustice on November 3rd.  Let's rise up once again on October 17th to finish the work we started three years ago. This is our best shot to stop the criminals in charge from stacking the Supreme Court and silencing our voices for years to come.  We must give it everything we have!    Get up, stand up - RISE UP for your rights!",,https://patch.com/virginia/herndon/herndon-womens-march-focuses-equity-voting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please park in the parking lot behind McDonalds. Those who do not want to/cannot march but want to participate, can bring a chair and display a sign. Those marching will cover a route along 260/87 to Bonita and back.  The march is supporting women’s rights, women’s health care under the ACA which is being challenged at the Supreme Court level in January, the bigotry shown by the Trump administration in nominating a candidate 37 days before the election, the important role that RBG played in making women’s lives better, and to urge people to Vote in November. To that end, here are some suggestions for signs:  VOTE – Tell them Ruth sent you  We Dissent! Stop the hypocrisy  No selection before election  Vote: Retake the Senate  Bad News for Healthcare  Fundamental Rights at Stake  Other ideas are welcome as long as they are not ""attack"" signs aimed at specific political entities. This is a PEACEFUL demonstration. There will be signs available that support voting and the rights of women. Please park responsibly, away from business parking, and wear a mask. We will be enforcing social distancing as well. Hope to see you there.",,https://www.paysonroundup.com/news/local/theme-of-the-2020-women-s-march-don-t-rush-to-replace-ginsburg/article_4d8da972-66d1-5d30-bd61-963de905c011.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most crucial election of our lifetimes is looming, and the current administration is threatening to stay in office no matter its outcome.

We are livid that Trump is rushing to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s Supreme Court seat with an illegitimate and extremist nominee, and we are done with the death-dealing of this administration.     We are taking action across the nation on October 17 to signal and strengthen our determination to finish what we started when millions of women first marched in January 2017. We’ve resisted those in power for three years, and now we are taking power back. Women will decide this election, defend its integrity, and fight together for the feminist future we need.""

This march welcomes anyone regardless of gender, skin color, or sexual orientation.    We'll meet on the lawn of President's Way Parking Lot in Balboa Park.     After a short speech, we'll march into the street, IN FRONT OF TRAFFIC, and head to high-profile POI's in San Diego.     We'll chant at some point during the march and observe silence at other times.    If you haven't attended a protest before, walking in the road can be a bit disconcerting at first. But then you'll feel empowered.     Remember, we're here to make an impact and be noticed!    The exact route is TBD by the number of participants, our energy, etc.     You can leave the march at any time you feel it becomes too much for you. Please be sure you have a ride on stand-by or quit at a point where you can make the return trip.    There will be no snacks, water, or other beverages available at the event since there wasn't time to organize refreshments.     Please eat a nutritious meal of complex carbohydrates, healthy protein, and fat to sustain you through the march, and make sure to hydrate well!    This is a no-trash event!!! Please don't bring packaged snacks or bottled water unless they're in re-usable containers.    Please bring plenty of water for yourself in non-disposable bottles, sunscreen, a hat, and anything else you need to feel comfortable. It's going to be warm.     Again – This is a no-waste event!!        COVID-19 Precautions:    Masks are required. You must wear a mask that fits well and stays put over your nose and mouth.     Anyone who displays a lack of concern for others' safety will be kindly asked to leave the group.    Chin diapers don't protect anyone. Masks that fall off your nose don't protect anyone.     Disposable hospital-style masks are cooler and easiest to breathe through. If you use one, be sure to break the straps before you throw it away so that animals don't get caught in them. They are bio-degradable.    Also, we'll all do the best we can to socially distance and still form a cohesive and powerful body of women.     But, you're taking a risk by participating.     Outdoor risk is lower than indoor, but there's still risk involved.     If you have chronic health issues that put you at high risk of developing a severe case of COVID 19, should you be exposed, it may be best to skip the march.    Please bring a sign if you like.     I look forward to making an impact with you.

Speakers will be from 12-1pm and announced as they are finalized.  So far confirmed are Daniella Levine Cava, Melba Pearson and Cindy Lerner. After getting inspiration from many of our favorite femme candidates and community leaders, we will get to work either canvassing on the issues, phone banking or sign waiving.  COMPLETE OUR RSVP FORM!  https://forms.gle/oXwaGfEvkiJ1yuGr6    We are joining the collective femme energy of the national Women's March October 17 weekend in efforts to save our democracy! In Miami, we will be marching with a purpose, getting out the vote and making sure communities are heard at the ballot box on November 3rd. We will gather at Women's March Miami's base camp in Wynwood to be inspired by your favorite femme candidates/community leaders and receive literature about early voting, mail in ballots and issues vital to all women with a stake in this election. Our #WhyWeVote campaign is about healthcare, this pandemic, Black, Native and LGBTQIA+ lives, clean air and water, education and our bodies. Folks will be grouped and assigned locations, and we will talk to women about why they need to vote and who they need to vote for in support of our ability to thrive. We'll have our 2020 ""Breaking Our Chains"" shirts beautifully designed by LeoArt available for our ""marchers"" as supplies last. Face masks are mandatory. Please wear comfortable shoes and be prepared for Miami weather (bring sunglasses, a hat, sunscreen and rain gear). We will also have a phone banking station and sign waving stations.    We're happy to have you at our Wynwood (base camp) location, but you can also host your own event at your chosen location that same day to bring the march to your community! You can also host a watch party of our rally before your folks get their boots on the ground!
